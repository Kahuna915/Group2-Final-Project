### How it is set up from a glance: 
    > So here we have our network, Please note the workstations are hooked up dynamically now
    > Our Domain Controllers would be DC01 and DC02 
    > Our servers our mgmt1 and mgmt2
    > We have two workstations and a utility machine that is considered a workstation
    > Our two DHCP servers automatically provide addresses for our two windows workstations 
    > We also have two DFS servers that store data and provide a useful allocation of resources on our network.
    > Finally we have a machine running the service drupal using Docker
